# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe AI

A desktop-based **Tic Tac Toe** game developed using **Python** and **Tkinter**, featuring an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) and an AI opponent with three difficulty levels. The project demonstrates game logic implementation, GUI development, and the **Minimax Algorithm** for optimal AI decision-making.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system
  
You can verify your installation by running:
```bash
python --version
```
---

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saicharan-r02/tictactoe-game
```
Move into the project folder:
```bash
cd tictactoe
```
---

## Run the Application
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```
The game window will open automatically.
---

# 🎮 How to Play

1. Launch the application.
2. Select a difficulty level.
3. The player always plays as **X**.
4. The computer always plays as **O**.
5. Click on an empty cell to place your move.
6. The AI responds automatically.
7. Continue until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
8. Click **New Game** to start another match.

# 🤖 AI Difficulty Levels

## 🟢 Easy

* Computer selects moves randomly.
* Suitable for beginners.

---

## 🟡 Medium

* Combines Easy and Hard strategies.
* 50% chance of making a random move.
* 50% chance of using the Minimax algorithm.

This creates a balanced gameplay experience.

---

## 🔴 Hard

Uses the **Minimax Algorithm**, which evaluates every possible future game state before making a move.

The AI:

* Always chooses the optimal move.
* Wins whenever possible.
* Blocks the player's winning moves.
* Forces a draw when winning is impossible.

---

# 🧠 Minimax Algorithm

The Hard difficulty uses the **Minimax Algorithm**, a recursive decision-making algorithm widely used in turn-based games.

## Working Principle

1. Generate every possible legal move.
2. Simulate future game states recursively.
3. Evaluate terminal states:

   * AI Win = **10 − Depth**
   * Player Win = **Depth − 10**
   * Draw = **0**
4. Choose the move with the highest evaluation score.

Using depth-based scoring allows the AI to:

* Win in the fewest possible moves.
* Delay losing when defeat is unavoidable.
* Play optimally throughout the game.

---

# 📊 Score Tracking

The application keeps track of:

* ✅ Wins
* ❌ Losses
* 🤝 Draws

Scores are updated automatically after every completed game.
